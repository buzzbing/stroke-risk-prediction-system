# stroke-risk-prediction-system
This project explores the use of IoT and machine learning in healthcare system to predict risk of heart stroke. It includes ESP8266 as the microcontroller to control load cell and ultrasonic sensor to measure height and weight of a person. A web application has been designed using Django framework to which the sensor collected data is sent and other data required data for stroke risk prediction is collected through Django form. Random forest algorithm has been used for risk prediction. All the data collcted has been stored using Django database system on the local disk.
